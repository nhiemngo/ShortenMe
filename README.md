# ShortenMe

### Deployed app on Heroku:

http://desolate-atoll-73195.herokuapp.com/

### Users can:

* Submit an URL and get it shortened.
* Be redirected to the correct URL when enter the shortened URLâ€™s link
* Access analytics with basic numbers at http://desolate-atoll-73195.herokuapp.com//[code]/stat

### Some information:

**Framework:** I decided to use Ruby on Rails as the main framework of this project since I have most experience with it.

**Hit count:** I use the [Impressionist](https://github.com/charlotte-ruby/impressionist) gem to count every time the redirect method is used. The hit count is displayed at /[code]/stat

**Front-end:**
I use Bootstrap and basic HTML/CSS for my app.
